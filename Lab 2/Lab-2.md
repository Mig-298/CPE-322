# Lab 2: Command Line

During this lab, we tested how to look at basic network and enviroment paramters inside of the terminal. We also learned how to navigate and change files inside of the terminal with certains commands that were given inside of the lab. Screenshots were not provided as there was a mass amount of text inside of the terminal.

There is also vital information that is displayed at certain points which is not secure to transmit out to the open internet.
