# Assignment 2
## Needs Assessment

**1. Identify needs that justify an electrical and computer engineering problem-solving effort.**

Needs that would justify an electrical and/or computer engineering problem-solving effort would be anything that requires circuits to properly work and may have something faulty with that. Radio Technology products wouldm also require the two to be able to have a good design behind it. 

**2. Develop a design proposal that justifies the need to develop a technical solution to a problem.**

* _Objective (why?)_ - Railroad Light system is malfunctioning, causing errors in the lighting system that the trains use for guidance on the tracks.
* **_Background (who? where?)_** - The MTA needs the lighting system to work on their 4 train near the 161st Street station. 
* **_Methodology (how? when?)_** - Engineers need to find the circuit that is causing the error and need to figure out the reasoning behind why the circuit is behaving that way. Once the problem has been found, it needs to be repaired within a day due to the fact that running the train is insanely dangerous but the train is an essential part of the mass transit. 
* **_Expected Results (what?)_** The expected results are the following: The engineers will succesfully find the problem with the circuit and report the costs/materials needed for the repair. After they report and get the resources needed to repair the cricuit, they will repair the circuit as quick as possible to have safe travel on that line once again. 
* **_Costs (how much will it cost?)_** The cost is very dependent on what is actually wrong with the circuit. Depending on the severity, it will most likely cost $2000+ to fix the issue.
