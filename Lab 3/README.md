For this lab, I installed the necessary libraries that I needed to run all of the pieces of code inside of my windows powershell. The programs ran fine and I gathered information about every single file. Below, I listed every file and what the code did when i ran it.

```
**Julian.py: **Told me the curretne calendar date as a julian date.
**Date_example.py: **Told me the date of the week, including day, month, year and different ways to show it.
**Datetime_example.py: **Showed me the date and the time when i ran it.
**time_example.py:** Told me the specific time down to the microseconds.
**moon.py:** Told me what the next moon phases will be for the upcoming monnth.
**Coordinates.py:** Told me the coordinates of specifially the Libarary.
**Address.py:** Told me the address of the specific coordinates.
**cpu.py:** Told me the cores and the threads of my cpu.
**Battery.py:** I do not have a battery so it did not work for me, I am guessingf it is for the battery percentage.
**documentstats.py:** Read the document.txt and outputted it.
